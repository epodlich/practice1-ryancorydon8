# Emma Name and Major
My name is Emma Podlich and my major is Biology and I am minoring in Data Science and Chemistry. 

# Emma Field of Study & Interests
I typically tell people that my field of study is undecided since I am still uncertain about what I would like to do after graduate. However, I would say that I have an interest in working as a Clinical Data Analyst but I am still exploring options to figure out more set goals. 

# Emma Activites
One of the main activites that I have been doing during school is conducting undergraduate research. I work on a research project that explores how vesicles affect cell migration which can be applied to cancer treatment practices. Another activity is my job at Ames Laboratory as an Office Assistant and there I do mainly data entry work but also any other office duties as needed by the staff. Also, I enjoy working out at the gym in my free time.

# Emma Tools to Organizing
One of the main ways I organize my work is by keeping a planner with all of my assignments with the dates that I complete them by. This helps me keep track of when I should start various assignments and I check each one off as I go to help keep me motivated. Also, I break up larger assignments into smaller chucks such as for lab reports I will do the "prelab" on one day, the "main report" on one day, and the "postlab" on another day so that I don't get overwhelmed. Lastly, I keep my school documents/files organized on my desktop and drive so that I can easily find the material for each class which makes me able to complete my assignements quicker as everything is in one placee and easy to find.
